Here is the **compact SRE-only requirement & implementation checklist** — minimal, clean, copy/paste-ready.

# ✅ **SRE – Requirements to Clarify (Compact List)**

### **Pipeline & Execution**

* Stage placement: run after TEST deployment?
* Should failures block promotion?
* Need warm-up/health-check delay?

### **Runner / Agent**

* Do we need a custom agent with Java + Maven + Chrome + Chromedriver?
* Browser/driver version compatibility?
* Resource requirements (CPU/memory/parallelism)?

### **Environment Access**

* TEST environment URL?
* Is TEST reachable from the Jules runner (network/VPC/firewall)?
* Health-check endpoint for readiness?

### **Secrets**

* Required secrets (test users, API tokens, JWTs)?
* Where to store? (Jules secure vars / Vault / AWS Secrets Manager)
* How to inject into Maven test run?

### **Reports**

* Exact Cucumber report directory?
* Required formats (JSON, HTML, JUnit)?
* Artifact retention period?

### **TestSight**

* API endpoint for upload?
* Authentication method?
* Expected payload format?
* Metadata needed (build number, run ID, environment)?
* Upload on success only or always?

### **Logging & Observability**

* Need to capture browser logs/screenshots?
* Alerts required (Slack/Email)?
* Any Splunk/Dynatrace integration?

# 🔧 **SRE – Implementation Steps (Compact Sequence)**

1. **Gather inputs** from QA/Tools: mvn command, report paths, secrets, TestSight API.
2. **Validate TEST connectivity** from Jules runner + configure health-checks.
3. **Prepare runner** with Java, Maven, Chrome, Chromedriver.
4. **Add E2E stage** in Jules → run `mvn clean test` with injected secrets.
5. **Collect & store reports** (JSON/HTML/screenshots) as artifacts.
6. **Implement TestSight upload** via script (Groovy/Python) with retries.
7. **Add notifications/observability** (Slack, logs, optional Splunk).
8. **Run dry-run validation** → fix failures, confirm upload works.
9. **Enable automated execution** on every TEST deployment → finalize runbook.

If you want, I can also create a **single-page Confluence-ready checklist** version.

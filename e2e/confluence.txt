# **📘 E2E Test Automation Integration Requirements – Jules Pipeline + Giene Framework + TestSight**

## **1. Overview**

This page captures all requirements needed to integrate the **Giene-based End-to-End Test Framework** (Java + Selenium + Cucumber) into the **Jules CI/CD pipeline**, and to publish Cucumber results into **TestSight**.

The goal is to automate E2E execution for the **TEST environment** as part of the release pipeline, ensuring complete visibility, reliability, and traceability of test results.

# **3. Scope**

### **In-Scope**

* Running E2E test suite using `mvn test` in Jules.
* Headless Selenium execution.
* Publishing Cucumber JSON/HTML reports as pipeline artifacts.
* Uploading Cucumber test results to TestSight.
* Integrating results into TestSight dashboards.
* Ensuring stable execution on TEST environment after deployment.

### **Out-of-Scope**

* Authoring or modifying Giene test cases.
* Manual testing activities.
* UAT/Production execution (future extension).

---

# **4. High-Level Workflow**

1. Deployment to TEST environment completes.
2. Jules triggers the E2E Test Stage.
3. Pipeline executes:

   * `mvn clean test` (Giene framework)
   * Selenium headless tests
4. Cucumber reports are generated under `/target/...`
5. Reports uploaded to TestSight.
6. Artifacts stored for audit.
7. Notifications sent to Slack/Email based on success/failure.

# **9. Flow Diagram (Insert After Requirements Are Finalized)**

**To be added**
Diagram will show:
**Jules → Deploy → TEST Env → mvn test → Cucumber Reports → TestSight Upload → Notifications**

---

# **10. Next Steps**

1. Gather missing inputs from QA, Dev, and Tools teams.
2. Finalize required agent image for test execution.
3. Design and implement Jules pipeline stage.
4. Validate TestSight upload with sample data.
5. Perform dry-run test execution.
6. Enable E2E testing for TEST deployments.

If you want, I can also generate:

✔ A **flow diagram (Mermaid or draw.io XML)**
✔ A **Jules pipeline YAML/Groovy template**
✔ A **TestSight upload code snippet** (Python/Groovy)
✔ A simpler **executive summary version** for managers

Just tell me which version you want next.

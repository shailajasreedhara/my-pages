SRE notes:

I have below info specific to a service
On-boarding requirement :  
On-board abc service with seil id s1 on to dev/test/qa/perf/prod env

As am sre i have to decide/pick
Which 
artifact-id
Business ID
ModelID
DeploymentID
Env
Tfe workspaces 
Infra yaml repo
Clustername
Side cars
Aws components 

This will be maintained at one place for each service level. Like property file or in some common place.
 Im going with maintaining property files for each business-id-artifactID ( we can define environment specific property with in)

Goal is to generate terraform files using infrastructure .yaml files, terraform workspace spaces.
I would be using some common env specific .tf templates.which must be included in the target .tf files.
Aws component specific templates 
I would be able to generate .Tf files using common env specific templates .tf format 
.tf fi

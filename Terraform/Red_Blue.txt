Below I’ll give a compact, practical set of **next steps + Terraform snippets + Spinnaker wiring** so your Spinnaker pipelines can safely deploy ECS services (red/black) and your tasks receive Dynatrace tokens securely from AWS Secrets Manager.

I’ll cover:

1. What Terraform must expose for Spinnaker to consume
2. How to store Dynatrace tokens in Secrets Manager with Terraform
3. How to inject those secrets into ECS task definitions (Fargate/EC2)
4. Required IAM permissions for ECS tasks to read secrets
5. How Spinnaker should be configured for Red/Black (Red/Black = Blue/Green) ECS deploys
6. Small notes on rotation, KMS, and CI flow

# 1) Terraform — outputs Spinnaker needs

Spinnaker needs the ALB, listener, target group names/ARNs and cluster/service names so it can attach a new task set to the ALB and do traffic shifting.

Example `outputs.tf` (terraform infra repo):

```hcl
output "alb_arn" {
  value = aws_lb.app_alb.arn
}

output "alb_listener_arn" {
  value = aws_lb_listener.front_end.arn
}

output "tg_blue_arn" {
  value = aws_lb_target_group.blue.arn
}

output "tg_green_arn" {
  value = aws_lb_target_group.green.arn
}

output "ecs_cluster_name" {
  value = aws_ecs_cluster.main.name
}

output "ecs_service_name" {
  value = aws_ecs_service.app_service.name
}
```

Expose these (and any ARNs) in a way Spinnaker can read them (S3 artifact, outputs file, or manually configured in the Spinnaker stage).

# 2) Create/store Dynatrace tokens in Secrets Manager (Terraform)

**Store tokens as Secrets Manager secrets** (one secret per token or combined JSON object). Don’t keep tokens in tfvars.

Example (single secret per token):

```hcl
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "dynatrace_api" {
  name = "dynatrace/api-token"
  description = "Dynatrace API token for shared tenant"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "dynatrace_api_value" {
  secret_id     = aws_secretsmanager_secret.dynatrace_api.id
  secret_string = var.dynatrace_api_token_plaintext
  # better: pass token via CI or parameter store, not in tfvars
}
```

Better pattern: create the secret in Secrets Manager manually or via pipeline and **do not** put the actual token into Terraform state. You can create the secret resource but set the secret value from CI via AWS CLI or parameterized pipeline.

If you want both tokens in one secret (JSON):

```hcl
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "dynatrace_all" {
  name = "dynatrace/tokens"
}

# set secret externally to avoid storing in state
```

---

# 3) Inject secrets into ECS task definition (Fargate / EC2)

Use the `secrets` field in the container definition so AWS injects the secret as an env var at runtime.

Example Terraform `aws_ecs_task_definition` snippet:

```hcl
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "app" {
  family                   = "orders-app"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"
  cpu                      = "512"
  memory                   = "1024"
  execution_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution.arn
  task_role_arn            = aws_iam_role.ecs_task.arn

  container_definitions = jsonencode([
    {
      name  = "app"
      image = var.container_image
      portMappings = [
        { containerPort = 8080, protocol = "tcp" }
      ]
      environment = [
        { name = "ENVIRONMENT", value = var.environment }
      ]
      secrets = [
        {
          name      = "DT_API_TOKEN"            # env var name inside container
          valueFrom = aws_secretsmanager_secret.dynatrace_api.arn
        },
        {
          name      = "DT_PAAS_TOKEN"
          valueFrom = aws_secretsmanager_secret.dynatrace_paas.arn
        }
      ]
      logConfiguration = {
        logDriver = "awslogs"
        options = {
          "awslogs-group"         = "/ecs/${var.environment}/orders"
          "awslogs-region"        = var.aws_region
          "awslogs-stream-prefix" = "orders"
        }
      }
    }
  ])
}
```

Notes:

* `valueFrom` can be the secret ARN or the specific secret ARN + JSON key path if you stored a JSON secret (e.g., `arn:aws:secretsmanager:...:secret:dynatrace/tokens:DT_API_TOKEN::`).
* Execution role must have permission to `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` (see next section).

---

# 4) IAM permissions — allow ECS task to read the secret

Attach policy to the **task role** (or task execution role depending on how you fetch secrets). Example minimal policy:

```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "ecs_task_secrets" {
  name = "ecs-task-secrets-access"
  role = aws_iam_role.ecs_task.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
          "kms:Decrypt"
        ]
        Resource = [
          aws_secretsmanager_secret.dynatrace_api.arn,
          aws_secretsmanager_secret.dynatrace_paas.arn
        ]
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

If Secrets Manager secret is KMS-encrypted with a CMK, include `kms:Decrypt` on that CMK.

# 5) Spinnaker configuration (Deploy (ECS) stage) — practical points

Spinnaker UI / pipeline stage settings (Red/Black):

* **Pipeline trigger:** Docker image push (artifact) or manual.
* **Deploy (ECS)** stage:

  * Account: aws-prod (Spinnaker AWS account)
  * Cluster: use the same cluster name Terraform created
  * Service name: `orders-service` (the one Terraform created or Spinnaker creates)
  * Container artifact: bind to the ECR image artifact the CI produced
  * **Strategy**: `Red/Black` (Spinnaker term for Blue/Green)
  * Load balancers: choose the ALB & listener; configure target group pair if needed
  * Check `Scale down old server group` (time window before disabling old)
* **Health checks & verification:**

  * Set health checks aligned with ALB target group (path/timeout)
  * Optionally add a **Canary** stage (Spinnaker/Kayenta) with Dynatrace as the metric source
* **Secrets & env overrides (if needed):**

  * If Spinnaker is rendering the task definition, ensure it does not accidentally overwrite injected secrets.
  * Better: let Terraform create task definition skeleton with the `secrets` block and let Spinnaker deploy new server group with updated image only.

Important: If Spinnaker manages task definitions, it must preserve the `secrets` block — validate that the Spinnaker config for the container includes the secret env var definitions (or uses task definition artifact created by Terraform).

---

# 6) Rotation, KMS, auditing, and pipeline flow

* **Rotation:** Rotate tokens in Secrets Manager periodically. When rotating, update secret value, ECS tasks will pick new secret next restart. For immediate effect, trigger a Spinnaker redeploy.
* **KMS:** Use a customer-managed CMK for stronger control and audit. Add `kms:Decrypt` to task role.
* **Audit:** Enable CloudTrail on Secrets Manager and use IAM conditions to limit access.
* **CI flow:** Jules builds image → pushes to ECR → triggers Spinnaker pipeline → Spinnaker launches new server group (green) using the new image → health checks → traffic shift → old server group disabled.

---

# Quick checklist for you to validate

* [ ] Terraform exposes ALB/Listener/TG/cluster/service outputs (or Spinnaker knows the names)
* [ ] Dynatrace tokens are stored as Secrets Manager secrets (no plaintext in tfstate)
* [ ] ECS task definition contains `secrets` references (valueFrom = secret ARN)
* [ ] Task role (or execution role as appropriate) has `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` + `kms:Decrypt` permissions for those secrets
* [ ] Spinnaker Deploy (ECS) stage configured as Red/Black and points at the ALB/target groups
* [ ] Health checks and canary integration (Dynatrace/Kayenta) configured for automated verification + rollback
* [ ] CI (Jules) triggers Spinnaker on successful image push

---

If you want, I can next:

* Generate a **complete Terraform module** that creates Secrets Manager secrets (but leaves secret values out of state), ECS task definition with `secrets` injection, and required IAM roles/policies; **or**
* Draft a **Spinnaker Deploy (ECS) stage JSON** you can import with example settings for Red/Black and artifact binding.

Which would be most useful right now?
